## Role Description

we will build an an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables in parquet format. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. we will be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.
